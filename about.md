## Personal Statement

<div style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 20px;font-weight: bold;"></span><span> As a Ph.D. candidate, I am working as a research associate in BIG (building informatics group) laboratory at Yonsei University. Currently, I am conducting research on development of construction project management system based on NLP (natural language processing) technology. Also, I have conducted research on the development of IoT-based smart exit sign system which is for evacuation guidance in buildings. From the research projects I have been involved in, I have learned software development management skills including analyzing and defining system requirements, designing system architectures, and detailed UI/UX of the system. Also through developing several prototype systems, I have learned programming software including Visual studio, Android studio, node.js, and Unity 3D. I believe my best ability is to explain to others the knowledge and logic that I have at an easily understandable level. </span></div>
